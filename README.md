## Introduction

Today in 2022 nearly everybody has realized that climate change is a serious problem the world will have to tackle in the near future. Every single one of us has personally experienced temperature increase over the last few summers and denying this development is not an option any longer. Having learnt the basic tools of data analysis I now want to do my own approach on analyzing data about temperature increase around the world, see if the warnings about a global temperature increase are reflected in data and as a second step look into factors which could be responsible for rising temperatures in certain countries where I have detected increasing temperatures. 

My goal is to create a database that includes information about the average temperatures and average temperature increase in different countries over a certain period of time, information about different economic sectors as well as their contribution to climate change/temperature increase, and data about the number of power plants with different fuel types in different countries. With this database I want to be able to make the analysis I want to gather the insights I am looking for regarding correlation between the different factors displayed and temperature increase.

To better understand the topic of climate change I am going to start by researching which factors can have an impact on our climate and could be responsible for temperature increase so I can specify my search for data sets on those factors. After retrieving the necessary information and raw data I need for my database, I will try to receive an overview of the data I have imported, perform exploratory data analysis and then clean it regarding the result of my observations. The next challenge will be setting the foundation of my database by deciding on how to structure my database and creating an entity-relationship model. With this foundation in mind I will continue by creating my database, setting up the different tables for my entities and then importing my cleaned data into the database. At this stage I will be able to start writing queries in order to gain the insights I am hoping to attain regarding the correlation between the decided on factors and temperature increase.
